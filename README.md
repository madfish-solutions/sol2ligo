# sol2ligo

Transpiler from Solidity to Ligo language for easier migrating to Tezos 🚀️

This project is Solidity to LIGO syntax converter and transpiler. It takes a `.sol` file as an input, parses it and yields PascalLIGO code as a result.
It is able to convert conditionals, loops, functions and many more. Also it can emulate state and create router for multple entrypoints.

The project is in _EXPERIMENTAL_: it may crash or silently skip some statements, resulting code may be insecure or even plain wrong. Please do not deploy anything without prior review and audit.

## 📖️ Example
Input solidity code

```solidity
contract FooBarContract {
  function foo(uint number) internal returns (int) {
    string[2] memory arr = ["hello", "world"];
    bool isEven = number % 2 == 0;
    int result = 42 * 42;
    return isEven ? -1 : result;
  }
}
```

Translated LIGO code
```js
function foo (const self : state; const number : nat) : (state * int) is
  block {
    const arr : map(nat, string) = map
      0n -> "hello";
      1n -> "world";
    end;
    const isEven : bool = ((number mod 2n) = 0n);
    const result : int = (42 * 42);
  } with (self, (case isEven of | True -> -(1) | False -> result end));
```

## 🏗️ Installation
You need to have NodeJS installed on your machine.
It was tested and developed using NodeJS v.10.13.0, but it’s expected to work on versions starting from v6.x.x up to v12.x.x

We suggest using node version manger (like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
# relogin or source ~/.bashrc
nvm i 12
```

To try it out you will need Node.js, NPM and Iced Coffee Script

```sh
npm i -g iced-coffee-script
npm i -g madfish-solutions/sol2ligo
```

Optional. You can install ligo compiler for tests

```
curl -o /tmp/ligo.deb https://ligolang.org/deb/ligo.deb
dpkg -i /tmp/ligo.deb
```

## 🌈️ Usage

```sh
sol2ligo <filename>
```

After transpiling you are likely gonna need to modify and thorougly audit the generated code. Follow transpiler warnings and comments inside the code to get more insight on what has to be done.

## 🏥️ Tests
You need clone github repository and install packages
```
git clone https://github.com/madfish-solutions/sol2ligo
cd sol2ligo
npm ci
```

For full test run
```sh
npm test 
```

For quick testing run
```sh
npm run test-ext-compiler-fast
```

To run specific test case
```sh
npm run test-specific <test-name>
```

## ⚒ Using sol2ligo as a node module

To add sol2ligo as a dependency, you need to install Iced Coffee Script first:
```sh
npm i -g iced-coffee-script
npm i madfish-solutions/sol2ligo
```
```javascript
const sol2ligo = require("sol2ligo");

console.log(sol2ligo.compile(sol_code, opt));
```
`opt` is optional. It's an object that can have these possible fields:
```javascript
{
  solc_version: String,           // self explanatory
  suggest_solc_version: String,   // suggested solc version if pragma is not specified
  auto_version: String,           // pick solc version based on the pragma directive in sol_code
  allow_download: Boolean,        // download solc catalog
  router: Boolean,                // generate router
  contract: String,               // name of contract to generate router for
  replace_enums_by_nats: Boolean, // transform enums to number constants
  debug: Boolean
}
```
The function returns an object with the following fields:
```javascript
{
  errors: Array,
  warnings: Array,
  ligo_code: String,
  default_state: String,
  prevent_deploy: Boolean
}
```
